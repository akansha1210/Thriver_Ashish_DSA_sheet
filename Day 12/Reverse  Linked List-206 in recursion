/*we assuming that our head is already reversed that's why we re calling reverse function from head.next*/
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if(head==null||head.next==null) return head;
        ListNode newHead=reverseList(head.next);/*we leave it to recursive leap of faith that it will reverse the linked list and will return the pointer to last node which is basically our new head*/
        ListNode headNext=head.next;
        headNext.next=head;
        head.next=null;
        return newHead;
    }
}
very easy if you know recursion
